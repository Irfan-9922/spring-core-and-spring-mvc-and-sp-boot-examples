                     Cunstructor injection
                     =====================
                     if you are using constroctor injection then it same as a by type mode of autowiring
                     if you having only one bean then and only one matching constructor then its going to workout
                     if you having multipal bean with same type then it gives an ambiguti error
                          
                          
                          Spetial case
                          ==============
                           in parant bean you must define the following code like:
                          <bean id="demo" class="com.ij.student5" autowire="constructor">
		                      <constructor-arg name="name" value="sdsd"/>
		                         <constructor-arg name="phno" value="23"/>
		
		
	                           </bean>
	                              <bean id="dod" class="com.ij.adress5">
	                                 <constructor-arg  value="latur"/>
	                                	<constructor-arg  value="0093"/>
	                                        </bean>
	                                        
	                                        the above code is working fine in the child bean if you not mention 
	                                        the member name also its working but in below condition it is not 
	                                        going to workout
	                                         <bean id="demo" class="com.ij.student5" autowire="constructor">
		                                        <constructor-arg  value="sdsd"/>
		                                            <constructor-arg  value="23"/>
		
		
	                                               </bean>
	                                                   <bean id="dod" class="com.ij.adress5">
	                                                       <constructor-arg  value="latur"/>
	                                                    	<constructor-arg  value="0093"/>
	                                                          </bean>
	                             
	                             Error for above condition:
